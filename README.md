# Abstract
Despite its abundance in the fossil record, grass pollen is largely overlooked as a source of ecological and evolutionary data because species and genera cannot be easily discriminated visually. However, superresolution imaging and deep learning can identify morphological differences among grass taxa by focusing on small variations in grain morphology and surface ornamentation. Using a semi-supervised learning strategy, we trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on image data from extant Poaceae species and unlabeled fossil samples. Semi-supervised learning improved the CNN models' capability to generalize feature recognition in fossil pollen specimens. Our models successfully capture morphological diversity among our 60 modern species and between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> grasses. We applied our trained models to fossil pollen images from a 25,000-year sediment core from Lake Rutundu, Mt Kenya, and identified a strong correlation between shifts in grass diversity and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels, temperature, precipitation, and fire frequency as measured by charcoal abundance. We quantified grass diversity by focusing on morphotypic variability, calculating Shannon entropy and morphotypic counts from the probability density function of specimens’ CNN features for each core depth. Predicted C<sub>3</sub> : C<sub>4</sub> abundances suggest a gradual increase in C<sub>4</sub> grass species correlated with rising temperature and fire activity. Our results demonstrate that machine-learned morphological features can significantly advance palynological analysis, enabling the estimation of biodiversity and distinction between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> grass pollen using morphology alone.


Grass pollen is largely overlooked in investigating grassland evolution because the pollen of most species cannot be differentiated using traditional optical microscopy. However, deep learning can quantify small variations in pollen morphology visible under superresolution microscopy. We use the abstract features output by deep learning to estimate the taxonomic diversity and physiology of fossil grass pollen assemblages. Using a semi-supervised learning strategy, we trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on superresolution pollen images of modern grasses and unlabeled fossil Poaceae. Our models captured features that reflected both the taxonomic diversity of grass communities along an elevational gradient and morphological differences between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> species. We applied our trained models to fossil grass pollen assemblages from a 25,000-year lake-sediment record from eastern equatorial Africa (Mt. Kenya) and correlated past shifts in grass diversity with atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and proxy records of local temperature, precipitation, and fire occurrence. We quantified changes in grass diversity using morphological variability of fossil pollen assemblages, approximated by the Shannon entropy of CNN features. Our data show that grassland species diversity was strongly reduced between 21,500 and 16,000 years ago, coincident with most severe regional cooling during the last ice age. C<sub>3</sub>:C<sub>4</sub> ratios reconstructed using a gradient-boosted decision tree classifier infer a gradual decrease in C<sub>4</sub> grasses since the late-glacial to Holocene transition, associated with decreasing fire activity and elevated temperatures. Our results demonstrate that CNN features of pollen morphology can advance palynological analysis, enabling robust estimation of grass diversity and C<sub>3</sub>:C<sub>4</sub> ratio in ancient grassland ecosystems. 

# Significance Statement 
Although the pollen of most grass species are morphologically indistinguishable using traditional optical microscopy, we show that they can be differentiated through deep learning analyses of superresolution images. Abstracted morphological features derived from convolutional neural networks can be used to quantify the biological and physiological diversity of grass pollen assemblages, without a priori knowledge of the species present, and used to reconstruct past changes in the taxonomic diversity and relative abundance of C<sub>4</sub> grasses in ancient grasslands. This approach unlocks ecological information previously unattainable from the fossil pollen record and demonstrates that deep learning can solve some of the most intractable identification problems in the reconstruction of past vegetation dynamics.

# Main Structure 
There are three main folders in this repository:
1. [Training and Classification](https://github.com/madaime2/Pollen_Diversity_Dynamics/tree/main/00_Training_and_Classification): Scripts for training the two classification models described in the paper using two modalities: maximum intensity projection (MIP) images, and patches.
2. [Diversity Estimation](https://github.com/madaime2/Pollen_Diversity_Dynamics/tree/main/01_Diversity_Estimation): Scripts for running the ecological simulations described in the paper and for applying Shannon entropy to calculate morphological diversity along the Lake Rutundu sediment core over the past 25,000 years. 
3. [Photosynthetic Pathway Analysis](https://github.com/madaime2/Pollen_Diversity_Dynamics/tree/main/02_Photosynthetic_Pathway_Analysis): Scripts for detecting morphological differences between C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> grass pollen while accounting for phylogenetic relatedness, and for developing a random forest classifier to identify the photosynthetic pathway (C<sub>3</sub> or C<sub>4</sub>) of grass fossil pollen based on morphology alone. 

# Hardware Specifications
Experiments were conducted on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX3090 GPU card with 24 GB of memory and an NVIDIA A100 SXM4 card with 40 GB of memory. We used the [PyTorch toolbox](https://pytorch.org/) for training neural networks. Additionally, some analyses were performed using R on a standard CPU.
